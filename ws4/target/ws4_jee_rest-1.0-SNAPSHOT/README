This is the same model and persistence as workshop 3 but here 
wrapped as a REST web service (no front end used, except a single test page). 
Need running database!

This is  NetBeans 8.2 Java Enterprise Maven project
Possible a bug in GlassFish 4.1.2? If so use Payara 4.1.2.173  
Payara is a spin off from GlassFish so server output says GlassFish
Payara is in /chamers/groups/ws-devel

If using the above everything should work out of the box. 

JEE Techniques used
- As in workshop 3 (minus view and control parts)
